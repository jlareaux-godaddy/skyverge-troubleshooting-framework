SkyVerge Troubleshooting Framework
===
A framework to guide the troubleshooting process for WordPress &amp; SkyVerge plugins.

Forward
---
This document is a draft.

The purpose of this document is to create a framework to guide the troubleshooting process. It is meant to help you take targeted measures to move the conversation forward.

While it will always be expanded upon to include more targeted troubleshooting paths, all convos should fit this model in its current state.

This is not a convo flow chart. This will not suggest when to request admin credentials. This is only meant to give you a next step :)

Premise
---
This framework works on the premise that WordPress and our plugins always work in a stock environment.

A stock environment means an unmodified, up-to-date codebase of both WordPress and our plugin(s).

A stock environment also includes the host, which varies greatly. For our purposes, verifying that WordPress and our plugins have what they need is usually adequate.

Purpose
---
This framework works is meant for daily use as a quick reference, or deep dive if needed. Between simply reading a step, the extended description, or a linked Confluence article, you can get the information you need to move a conversation forward.

Instructions
---
This is an XML document which is meant to be read from top to bottom, entering into child elements as troubleshooting paths.

If two different paths seem applicable, go to the topmost one first, as the topmost element takes precedence over its siblings.
